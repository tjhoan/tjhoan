### About Me 🌟
I am a **sixth-semester student** at **Universidad del Valle**, driven by a strong passion for facing and solving challenges. My ultimate goal is to grow in a **professional environment** where I can:
- **Learn from experts in the field** 🧠
- **Apply my skills effectively** 💻
- **Contribute meaningfully** to the success of the team 🤝

I am currently seeking my **first professional opportunity** through an internship or an entry-level position where I can put my skills into practice and gain hands-on experience. I am also eager to **collaborate on innovative projects** that allow me to explore new technologies and develop software solutions that make a real-world impact.
